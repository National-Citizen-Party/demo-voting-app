## 🗳️ What You Need to Know

This is a **transparent and secure** voting system where your vote is encrypted before it's submitted. Nobody can see how you voted except the election observers after voting closes.

## 📋 How It Works (Simple Version)

### Step 1: You Get a Secret Ballot Code
- You'll receive a unique ballot code (like `BALLOT-001`)
- This is your "ticket" to vote - keep it private!
- Each code can only be used once

### Step 2: You Cast Your Vote
1. Enter your ballot code
2. Select your preferred candidates for each position
3. Your choices are shown to you in plain text
4. **Important:** Save a copy of your vote for your records

### Step 3: Your Vote Gets Locked in a Safe
- Your vote is automatically "locked" (encrypted) using a special key
- Think of it like putting your vote in a locked safe that only election observers can open
- Once locked, nobody can read it - not even the computer system!

### Step 4: Your Locked Vote is Submitted
- The locked vote is sent to the system
- You can verify it was received by checking the public dashboard
- Your locked vote is visible to everyone, but nobody can read what's inside

### Step 5: After Voting Closes, Votes are Counted
- Election observers use their special key to unlock all votes
- They count the results and announce the winners
- Everything happens transparently

## 🔒 Why This is Very Safe

### 1. **Your Vote is Secret**
- Your vote is encrypted (locked) on YOUR device before it leaves your computer
- The server never sees your actual choices - only the locked version
- It's like sealing your vote in an envelope before mailing it

### 2. **You Can Verify Everything**
- After voting, you can check the public dashboard to confirm your encrypted vote was recorded
- Compare it with the copy you saved - they should match exactly
- If something's wrong, you can report it immediately

### 3. **No One Can Cheat**
- The system can't change your vote because it's encrypted
- The system can't see how you voted
- The system can't create fake votes because each ballot code works only once

### 4. **Transparent Process**
- All encrypted votes are publicly visible (but unreadable)
- Anyone can count how many votes were submitted
- Observers decrypt votes together in front of everyone

### 5. **Multiple Safeguards**
- **Ballot codes:** Only valid voters can participate
- **One vote per code:** Can't vote twice
- **Encryption:** Votes are protected from tampering
- **Public dashboard:** Everyone can verify votes were recorded
- **Observer oversight:** Multiple people must agree to count votes

## 🤔 Common Questions

### Q: Can someone see how I voted?
**A:** No! Your vote is encrypted (locked) before it leaves your device. Only election observers can unlock votes after voting closes, and they see all votes together - not who voted for whom.

### Q: What if I lose my ballot code?
**A:** Contact the election administrators. They can verify your identity and provide your code. Don't share your code with anyone else.

### Q: Can I change my vote after submitting?
**A:** No. Once submitted, your vote is final. This prevents vote manipulation. Choose carefully!

### Q: What if the system crashes?
**A:** All votes are stored safely. Even if the website goes down, your encrypted vote is already saved. The system can be restarted without losing any votes.

### Q: How do I know my vote was counted?
**A:** 
1. You'll receive a vote ID number when you submit
2. Check the public dashboard to see your encrypted vote
3. After counting, observers will publish the total results

### Q: What's the difference between "plain text" and "encrypted" vote?
**A:** 
- **Plain text:** Your actual choices (readable by you)
- **Encrypted:** Your choices locked in a safe (looks like random characters)

Think of it like writing a letter (plain text) and then putting it in a locked safe (encrypted).

### Q: Why should I save my votes?
**A:** So you can verify your vote was recorded correctly on the public dashboard. It's your receipt!
